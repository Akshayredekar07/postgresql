#### **LEFT JOIN**
The **LEFT JOIN** keyword selects **ALL** records from the "left" table and the matching records from the "right" table. If there is no match, the result includes **NULL** values for columns from the right table.

Let's look at an example using our dummy `testproducts` table:

| testproduct_id | product_name           | category_id |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1              | Johns Fruit Cake       | 3           |
| 2              | Marys Healthy Mix      | 9           |
| 3              | Peters Scary Stuff     | 10          |
| 4              | Jims Secret Recipe     | 11          |
| 5              | Elisabeths Best Apples | 12          |
| 6              | Janes Favorite Cheese  | 4           |
| 7              | Billys Home Made Pizza | 13          |
| 8              | Ellas Special Salmon   | 8           |
| 9              | Roberts Rich Spaghetti | 5           |
| 10             | Mias Popular Ice       | 14          |

(10 rows)

We will join the `testproducts` table with the `categories` table:

| category_id | category_name  | description                                              |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Beverages      | Soft drinks, coffees, teas, beers, and ales              |
| 2           | Condiments     | Sweet and savory sauces, relishes, spreads, and seasonings |
| 3           | Confections    | Desserts, candies, and sweet breads                      |
| 4           | Dairy Products | Cheeses                                                  |
| 5           | Grains/Cereals | Breads, crackers, pasta, and cereal                      |
| 6           | Meat/Poultry   | Prepared meats                                           |
| 7           | Produce        | Dried fruit and bean curd                                |
| 8           | Seafood        | Seaweed and fish                                         |

(8 rows)

**Note**: Many products in `testproducts` have a `category_id` that does not match any categories in the `categories` table.

By using **LEFT JOIN**, we will get **all records** from `testproducts`, even those with no match in the `categories` table, with **NULL** for unmatched `category_name` values.

#### **Example**
Join `testproducts` to `categories` using the `category_id` column:

```sql
SELECT testproduct_id, product_name, category_name
FROM testproducts
LEFT JOIN categories ON testproducts.category_id = categories.category_id;
