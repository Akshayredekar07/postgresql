PostgreSQL was invented at the Berkeley Computer Science Department, University of California.

Note: Always end SQL statements with a semicolon ;

SQL Shell waits for the semicolon and executes all lines as one SQL statement.

A multiple lines SQL statement is not executed before we include a semicolon at the end.
