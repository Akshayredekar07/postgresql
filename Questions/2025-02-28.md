### Problem Statement

Given below table `2028` as Input which has two columns `Group` and `Sequence`,  
Write a SQL query to find the maximum and minimum values of continuous `Sequence` in each `Group`.

### **Input Table: Emp**

| Group | Sequence |
|-------|---------|
| A     | 1       |
| A     | 2       |
| A     | 3       |
| A     | 5       |
| A     | 6       |
| A     | 8       |
| A     | 9       |
| B     | 11      |
| C     | 1       |
| C     | 2       |
| C     | 3       |

### **Expected Output:**

| Group | Min_Seq | Max_Seq |
|-------|---------|---------|
| A     | 1       | 3       |
| A     | 5       | 6       |
| A     | 8       | 9       |
| B     | 11      | 11      |
| C     | 1       | 3       |

### **Create the Table `0228`**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE "0228" (
    "Group" TEXT,
    "Sequence" INT
);
```

---

### **Insert Data**  
```sql
INSERT INTO "0228" ("Group", "Sequence") VALUES
('A', 1), 
('A', 2), 
('A', 3), 
('A', 5), 
('A', 6), 
('A', 8), 
('A', 9), 
('B', 11), 
('C', 1), 
('C', 2), 
('C', 3);
```
---

### **STEP 1: Add Row Number**
```sql
SELECT "Group",
       "Sequence",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Group" ORDER BY "Sequence") AS rnk
FROM "0228";
```

---

### **STEP 2: Identify Sequence Groups**
```sql
SELECT "Group",
       "Sequence",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Group" ORDER BY "Sequence") AS rnk,
       "Sequence" - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Group" ORDER BY "Sequence") AS Grp_Split
FROM "0228";
```

---

### **FINAL QUERY: Find Min and Max Sequence in Each Group**
```sql
SELECT "Group",
       MIN("Sequence") AS Min_Seq,
       MAX("Sequence") AS Max_Seq
FROM (
    SELECT "Group",
           "Sequence",
           "Sequence" - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY "Group" ORDER BY "Sequence") AS Split
    FROM "0228"
) A
GROUP BY "Group", Split
ORDER BY "Group";
```

### **How It Works:**
1. `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique rank to each row **within each group**, ordered by `Sequence`.
2. The key trick is **calculating** `"Sequence" - ROW_NUMBER()`, which helps detect gaps:
   - If numbers are **continuous**, this value remains the same.
   - When a gap appears, it changes, forming a new group.
3. **Group by `"Group"` and `Split`**, then use `MIN()` and `MAX()` to find the range of each contiguous sequence.

### **Output:**
| Group | Min_Seq | Max_Seq |
|-------|--------|--------|
| A     | 1      | 3      |
| A     | 5      | 6      |
| A     | 8      | 9      |
| B     | 11     | 11     |
| C     | 1      | 3      |

- **Efficient:** Uses **window functions** instead of recursion.
- **Scalable:** Works on large datasets efficiently.
- **Simple:** Only requires a single `WITH` clause (or inline subquery).
