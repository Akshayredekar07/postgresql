### **Problem: Find the Second Highest Salary**  

Write a SQL query to find the second-highest salary from the `Employee` table.  

**Table Schema:**  
```
Employee  
+----+-------+--------+  
| Id | Name  | Salary |  
+----+-------+--------+  
| 1  | John  | 100    |  
| 2  | Alice | 200    |  
| 3  | Bob   | 300    |  
| 4  | Eva   | 300    |  
| 5  | Mark  | 400    |  
+----+-------+--------+  
```

**Expected Output:**  
```
+--------+  
| Salary |  
+--------+  
| 300    |  
+--------+  
```

**Explanation:**  
The highest salary is `400`. The second-highest salary is `300`.

**Bonus:** Solve it without using `LIMIT` or `TOP`.

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the database
CREATE DATABASE questions;

-- Step 2: Connect to the questions database
\c questions

-- Step 3: Create the Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Salary INT
);

-- Step 4: Insert data into the Employee table
INSERT INTO Employee (Name, Salary) VALUES
('John', 100),
('Alice', 200),
('Bob', 300),
('Eva', 300),
('Mark', 400);
```


### **1. Using `LIMIT`**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `ORDER BY Salary DESC`: Sorts salaries in descending order.  
  - `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1`: Skips the highest salary and fetches the second-highest salary.



### **2. Using `MAX` with a Subquery**
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - The inner query gets the maximum salary (`400` in this case).  
  - The outer query finds the maximum salary that is less than the result of the inner query, i.e., the second-highest salary.



### **3. Using `DISTINCT` and `ORDER BY`**
```sql
SELECT Salary
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 2
) AS Temp
ORDER BY Salary ASC
LIMIT 1;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - The inner query selects the top two unique salaries in descending order.  
  - The outer query selects the second salary by sorting in ascending order and limiting the result to 1.



### **4. Using `DENSE_RANK()` (For RDBMS supporting Window Functions)**
```sql
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE Rank = 2;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - The `DENSE_RANK()` function assigns a rank to each salary in descending order.  
  - Salaries with the same value get the same rank.  
  - We filter out the salary with rank 2, which is the second-highest salary.



### **5. Using `ROW_NUMBER()` (For RDBMS supporting Window Functions)**
```sql
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT Salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM Employee) AS DistinctSalaries
)
SELECT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE RowNum = 2;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `ROW_NUMBER()` assigns a unique rank to each distinct salary in descending order.  
  - The salary with `RowNum = 2` is the second-highest.



### **6. Using `NOT IN`**
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - The inner query finds the highest salary.  
  - The outer query excludes the highest salary and returns the maximum of the remaining salaries.



### **7. Using `RANK()` (Handles Duplicates)**
```sql
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT Salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Employee
)
SELECT Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE Rank = 2;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - `RANK()` assigns a rank to each salary, with duplicate salaries getting the same rank.  
  - The salary with `Rank = 2` is the second-highest.



### **8. Without Using Window Functions or Subqueries**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT E1.Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee E1, Employee E2
WHERE E1.Salary < E2.Salary
GROUP BY E1.Salary
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT E2.Salary) = 1;
```
- **Explanation:**  
  - This self-join ensures that `E1.Salary` is less than exactly one distinct higher salary.  
  - The result is the second-highest salary.



### **9. Handling Edge Cases**
For cases where there is no second-highest salary (e.g., if all employees have the same salary):
```sql
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

-- To return NULL if there is no second-highest salary:
SELECT (
    SELECT MAX(Salary) 
    FROM Employee
    WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee)
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
```

---

The key difference between `RANK` and `DENSE_RANK` in SQL lies in how they handle ranking when there are ties (i.e., rows with the same value in the order column):

---

### **1. `RANK` Window Function**
- **Behavior:** Skips ranks for ties.
- **Gap:** Creates gaps in ranking when there are ties.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
  FROM Employee;
  ```
  **Result:**
  ```
  Name   | Salary | Rank
  -------|--------|-----
  Mark   | 400    | 1
  Bob    | 300    | 2
  Eva    | 300    | 2
  Alice  | 200    | 4
  John   | 100    | 5
  ```

  - Tied rows (`Bob` and `Eva`) get the same rank (`2`), and the next rank skips to `4`.

### **2. `DENSE_RANK` Window Function**
- **Behavior:** Does not skip ranks for ties.
- **No Gap:** Consecutive ranks even when there are ties.
- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
  FROM Employee;
  ```
  **Result:**
  ```
  Name   | Salary | DenseRank
  -------|--------|----------
  Mark   | 400    | 1
  Bob    | 300    | 2
  Eva    | 300    | 2
  Alice  | 200    | 3
  John   | 100    | 4
  ```

  - Tied rows (`Bob` and `Eva`) still get the same rank (`2`), but the next rank is `3`, without skipping.



| **Feature**     | **RANK**           | **DENSE_RANK**       |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Rank Skipping** | Skips ranks for ties | No skipping of ranks |
| **Use Case**      | Identify gaps in rank | Compact rankings      |
